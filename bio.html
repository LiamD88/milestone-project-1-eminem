                    <p class="bio-paragraph text-center">Eminem is an American rapper, record producer and actor known as one of the most controversial and best-selling artists of the early 21st century. Who Is Eminem? Born Marshall Bruce Mathers III on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri.
                        He never knew his father, Marshall Mathers Jr., who abandoned the family when Eminem was still an infant and rebuffed all of his son's many attempts to contact him during his childhood. As a result, Eminem was raised by his mother,
                        Deborah Mathers. They moved frequently between Missouri and Detroit, Michigan, spending large chunks of time in public housing projects. "I would change schools two, three times a year," Eminem later recalled. "That was probably
                        the roughest part about it all." This itinerant lifestyle left a large impact on his personality. He had no close friends, kept almost entirely to himself and was treated like an outcast at each new school. "Beat up in the bathroom,
                        beat up in the hallways, shoved into lockers," he remembered. Eminem has been scathingly critical of the way his mother raised him.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="bio-paragraph text-center">Eminem attended Lincoln High School in Warren, Michigan, where he failed the ninth grade three times and eventually dropped out at the age of 17. Despite being a poor student, Eminem always had a deep affinity for language, devouring
                        comic books and even studying the dictionary. "I found that no matter how bad I was at school, like, and no matter how low my grades might have been at some times, I always was good at English ... I just felt like I wanna be able
                        to have all of these words at my disposal, in my vocabulary at all times whenever I need to pull 'em out. You know, somewhere, they'll be stored, like, locked away."</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="bio-paragraph text-center">As a teenage dropout, Eminem found a way to express his passion for language, as well as to release his youthful anger, through the emerging musical genre of hip-hop. Although at the time rap music was almost exclusively produced by
                        black people, Eminem, who has pale white skin and bright blue eyes, nevertheless entered into the Detroit rap scene as a frequent competitor in rap "battles"—competitions in which two rappers take turns insulting the other through
                        improvised rap lyrics. Eminem proved highly skilled at such verbal sparring and, despite his race, quickly became one of the most respected figures in Detroit's underground rap scene. He recalled, "I finally found something that
                        yeah, this kid over here, you know, he may have more chicks, and he may, you know, have better clothes, or whatever, but he can't do this like me. You know what I mean? He can't write what I'm writing right now. And it started
                        to feel like, you know, maybe Marshall's gettin' a little respect." Mathers assumed the stage name M&M, a playful reference to his initials, which he later began writing phonetically as "Eminem." This period in Eminem's life—working
                        odd jobs to make ends meet while participating in rap battles and desperately attempting to land a record contract—was later dramatized in Eminem's semi-autobiographical film, 8 Mile.</p>

                    <br><p class="bio-paragraph text-center">It was also during this period that Eminem began dating Kim Ann Scott, and in 1995 the couple had a daughter named Hailie Jade Scott. Inspired by the birth of his daughter Hailie to make a living as a rapper, in 1996, Eminem released
                        his first independent rap album, Infinite. Though the album displayed flashes of his verbal prowess, biting wit and flair for storytelling, the low-budget record failed to turn a profit or attract more than local attention. However
                        a year later, Eminem released The Slim Shady EP, which was discovered by Dr. Dre. After Eminem traveled to Los Angeles and became runner-up in the 1997 Rap Olympics MC Battle, Dre listened to the rapper's cassette in the basement
                        of executive Jimmy Iovine's home. Dre was so impressed that he signed Eminem to his Interscope Records label.In 1999, Eminem released The Slim Shady LP, the heavily hyped record became an instant success and went on to sell over
                        three million copies. Eminem's first single, "My Name Is," mixed a childish humor and energy with rampant profanity and flashes of violence—a potent and fascinating combination that felt different from anything else in rap.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="bio-paragraph text-center">Marshall Mathers Eminem released his second studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP, in May 2000. The album showed off Eminem's poetic talents as well as his emotional and artistic range. His songs vary from manically funny ("The Real
                        Slim Shady") to heartbreakingly poignant ("Stan") to explosively violent ("Kim") to disarmingly self-critical ("The Way I Am"). The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 19 million copies worldwide, won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album,
                        received a nomination for Album of the Year and is widely considered among the greatest rap albums of all time. Nevertheless, The Marshall Mathers LP also came under a firestorm of criticism for its excessive profanity, glorification
                        of drugs and violence and its apparent homophobia and misogyny. While Eminem attempted to mitigate such criticism by maintaining that his raps simply use the rough language he has been surrounded by since childhood, and later by
                        performing a duet with Elton John at the Grammy Awards to demonstrate his openness to the gay community, Eminem nevertheless remains reviled in some quarters for his offensive lyrical content. In 2001, Eminem reconnected with several
                        of his friends from the Detroit underground rap scene to form the group D12, recording an album called Devil's Night. A year later, The Eminem Show, another popular and critically acclaimed album highlighted by the tracks "Without
                        Me," "Cleaning Out my Closet" and "Sing for the Moment." His next album, 2004's Encore, was less successful than his previous efforts, but still featured popular songs such as "Like Toy Soldiers" and "Mockingbird."</p>

                        Around this time Eminem became addicted to sleeping pills and prescription painkillers. In December 2007, he overdosed and nearly died. "If I would have got to the hospital two hours later, that would have been it," he said. By early 2008, Eminem had
                        managed to kick his addictions to drugs and alcohol and returned to recording music. He released his first album of new music in five years, Relapse, in 2009, featuring the singles "Crack a Bottle" and "Beautiful." In 2010, Eminem
                        released another album, Recovery, a highly autobiographical attempt to come to terms with his struggles with addiction and experience with rehabilitation. His most acclaimed album in years, Recovery struck a somewhat gentler and
                        more inspirational tone than his previous music. Eminem said, "I don't want to go overboard with it but I do feel like that if I can help people that have been through a similar situation, then, you know, why not?" The revealing
                        album won Eminem a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. Eminem is doubtlessly one of the most acclaimed rappers in the genre's brief history. As much as any other individual artist, he is responsible for rap's transformation into a
                        mainstream music genre over the past decade.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="bio-paragraph text-center">And after 10 years and seven albums, the rapper who shocked, appalled and fascinated the music world with the unbridled rage of his youthful music is reinventing himself as a mature artist. "I started learning how to not be so angry
                        about things, learning how to count my f---ing blessings instead. By doing that, I've become a happier person, instead of all this self-loathing I was doing for a while," Eminem said. "The music, I wouldn't say it's gotten happier,
                        but it's definitely more upbeat. I feel like myself again." 'MMLP2' Eminem released his eighth album, MMLP2, on November 5, 2013. He went to reach of the top of charts with "The Monster," a track that also featured Rihanna and
                        earned a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. </p>

                    <p class="bio-paragraph text-center">In 2014, Eminem celebrated the 15th anniversary of his Shady Records label with a special two-CD set called ShadyXV. The collection features the label's most popular songs as well as some new material. Eminem made headlines for a freestyle
                        segment on the BET Hip Hop Awards, in which he ripped into President Donald Trump. Two months later, he released his ninth studio offering, Revival but the album as a whole divided critics and failed to garner the accolades notched
                        by his previous efforts. While four years passed between Eminem's eighth and ninth albums, fans only had to wait a few months before he dropped his next studio effort, Kamikaze, on August 31, 2018. The surprise album featured Eminem
                        attacking a multitude of rappers who had criticised his previous album and was widely heralded as a triumphant return to form for Marshall Mathers.</p>
