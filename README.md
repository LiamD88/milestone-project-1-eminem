# Milestone Project 1 - Eminem 
---
I have created a website aimed towards Eminem fans. The target audience being hardcore fans, whilst also allowing the more casual listener to enjoy. 
The website will allow you to listen to songs and videos ranging from both the start of his career to the most recent of his catalogue. The user can enjoy
photos from the tour and feel they can take part in this by either applying for presale tickets or the competition to actually go to a concert.

# UX
---
The website design was created with the idea of the more hardcore eminem fans in mind and to allow any user to navigate easily through the website. 
I chose a dark colour theme as I feel this is easier on the eyes and also fits in with the artist. The first 2 webpages home and biography have an all black appearance.
the next 3 the music, tour and competition page are black in the upper section and a lighter gray below which allows the site to progress and to keep the theme and website progression consistent.
I used container-fluid a lot while building this website as I wanted the content to fill the full width of the page.

Home page is kept minimal and features a sole image of eminem with lyrics fading in and out below, the lyrics range from some of his biggest hits that most listeners would know and then an obscure lyric from a song that only the most hardcore fans would know, making them feel intrigued even further by the site. There is a navigation bar at the top which highlights the text in red of the current page you are on and also at the bottom of the page links to social sites.

Biography page has 2 images on in the top left and one in the top right for aesthtics again with the same navbar and socail links. The biography gets very detailed, most hardcore fans would enjoy reading this and if a casual listener feels the need they can delve in and read up on the artists life and career from start to finish.

Music page allows users to enjoy a carousel which displays the artists discography and you can click the images to browse again the same navbar and social links. There is 4 youtube videos which again will appease the more casual user. There are also 4 songs at the bottom of the page aimed at the more hardcore user and most casuals listeners won't have heard them.

Tour page has same navbar and social links and has 4 carousels at the top of the page which allow users to click through and see photos of the tour for more interaction. The bottom half lists upcoming tour venues and users can apply for when presale tickets become available allowing more interaction.

Competition page has a large image when you land of eminem with his fingers up, synomonous with this artist and his image for both new and hardcore fans. Placed on the final page almost as if goodbye and keep in tow with the home page being very minimal. The bottom half again has just another form to fill in to allow you to apply and win tickets to see the artist again more interaction. Same navbar and social links.

## User Stories

The website is aimed at eminem fans as a fanpage to cater for both new, old and extreme fans different user stories listed below.

1. As a huge eminem fan I appreciate the detailed biography to showcase where my hero has come from to reach his current position in music. I also enjoy the older eminem songs, its nice to visit a website that has these songs available to listen to and now know I'm not the only person who has access to this. The fact these are available makes this worth revisiting.

2. As a casual listener of eminem I like that they have a videos of some of his biggest hits I know and I can apply to win tickets to his upcoming shows. The biography seems very detailed, it wouldnt be for me, but at least its on its own page and I can browse the other pages without getting into this.

3. As a rap music enthusiast this seems like a nicely designed page with easy access to what I want. I can check out some of the Eminem songs I might not have heard yet and I like these tours photos its good to see this rapper is still out there touring. The discography section is really good I don't have all of these albums, I'll be sure to check them out.

4. As a hip hop fan who enjoys going to rap concerts my google search brought me to the upcoming tour dates. I will definetely fill in the presale ticket form as I want to get these tickets. Also very nice that they have a competition page to win tickets, maybe I wont even have to pay for my mine!

5. As a general music fan I like the minimal design of this website it is really easy to navigate around. I can find the music on one page, the huge autobiography gives me an insight into the artist, and I like these tour photos, there is a quite a few so this should could me engaged. Seems to be a competition for tickets, I might aswell apply because who wouldn't want to win free tickets to see Eminem.

# Features 
---
### Home 
The home page has 2 main features. The first is the hero image you see which is designed to capture the users attention and is the main point of this page. The next feature is the song lyrics under the hero image which fade in and out to create animation so as it is not completely static and feels like an interaction. When you go to mobile view only one of the song lyrics will display so as not to completely take over the screen and bog the user down too much.

The home page is kept minimal with the idea to to encourage the user to click on the other pages and delve further into the website. It contains a navigation bar at the top of the page which highlights the current page you are on in red text and you can click each page without having to go back. It also contains a footer which has links to social sites for the artist on facebook, youtube, instagram and twitter. 

### Biography
The biography page has 3 images as its main feature one in the top left corner , in the middle of the page and one in the bottom right hand corner when on larger screens. On mobile the top left image will stick to the top of the page before the text, the middle image between paragraphs and the final image will display underneath the text. I am aware that it can seem like a lot of text for a user to take in but this is the point of this page it is about getting information about the artist. A lot of fans enjoy reading in this much detail and the ones who don't can have a quick breeze over it. I kept the same all black background with white text as the home page and this page contains the same navigation bar and footer as the home page.

### Music
The music page has 3 main features, the first being the discography which I placed in the center at the top of the page. The discography is placed in a carousel with images of all the eminem albums arranged in chronological order with the name of each album also displayed at the bottom of the carousel. You can click along making this an interactive feature for the user. The next feature is 4 youtube videos, on larger screens they are arranged with 2 videos side by side on top of 2 videos also side by side. On mobile devices it will be one video on top of another. Again another interactive feature for the user.

The final feature is 4 songs that are playable at the bottom of the page, in keeping the same as the youtube video layout they are arranged 2 side by side on top of the other 2 which will then be placed on top of each other on mobile view. The top half of the page is in black around the carousel keeping in line with the first 2 pages but the bottom half is a shade of grey to show the new section for music. This page also has the same navigation bar and footer as the previous ones.

### Tour
The tour page has 3 main features. The top half of the page contains 4 carousels with images from tours, you can you click through the images for interaction, there is also a list of upcoming tour dates below the carousels. There is a form you can fill in for presale tickets and again the same navigation bar and footer as the previous pages.

### Competition
The competition page has 2 main features. The main image on this page is designed as to have eminem with his fingers up for the final page which eminem fans will enjoy. The second feature is another form below to fill in which you can enter a competition to win free tickets and a meet and greet with eminem. Adding some interaction to the page, the same navigation bar and footer as the previous pages.


### Future Features
 * Adding a merchandise section so people can purchase music, t-shirts, vinyl records etc.
 * Create a mailing list so people can get updates about any music or news regarding the artist coming out.
 * A section dedicated to song lyrics that people can read through.
 * A forum for fans to discuss music and the artist themself.
