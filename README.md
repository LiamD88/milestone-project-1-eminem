# Milestone Project 1 - Eminem 
---
I have created a website aimed towards Eminem fans. The target audience being hardcore fans, whilst also allowing the more casual listener to enjoy. 
The website will allow you to listen to songs and videos ranging from both the start of his career to the most recent of his catalogue. The user can enjoy
photos from the tour and feel they can take part in this by either applying for presale tickets or the competition to actually go to a concert.

# UX

The website design was created with the idea of the more hardcore eminem fans in mind and to allow any user to navigate easily through the website. 
I chose a dark colour theme as I feel this is easier on the eyes and also fits in with the artist. The first 2 webpages home and biography have an all black appearance.
the next 3 the music, tour and competition page are black in the upper section and a lighter gray below which allows the site to progress and to keep the theme and website progression consistent.

Home page is kept minimal and features a sole image of eminem with lyrics fading in and out below, the lyrics range from some of his biggest hits that most listeners would know and then an obscure lyric from a song that only the most hardcore fans would know, making them feel intrigued even further by the site. There is a navigation bar at the top which highlights the text in red of the current page you are on and also at the bottom of the page links to social sites.

Biography page has 2 images on in the top left and one in the top right for aesthtics again with the same navbar and socail links. The biography gets very detailed, most hardcore fans would enjoy reading this and if a casual listener feels the need they can delve in and read up on the artists life and career from start to finish.

Music page allows users to enjoy a carousel which displays the artists discography and you can click the images to browse again the same navbar and social links. There is 4 youtube videos which again will appease the more casual user. There are also 4 songs at the bottom of the page aimed at the more hardcore user and most casuals listeners won't have heard them.

Tour page has same navbar and social links and has 4 carousels at the top of the page which allow users to click through and see photos of the tour for more interaction. The bottom half lists upcoming tour venues and users can apply for when presale tickets become available allowing more interaction.

Competition page has a large image when you land of eminem with his fingers up, synomonous with this artist and his image for both new and hardcore fans. Placed on the final page almost as if goodbye and keep in tow with the home page being very minimal. The bottom half again has just another form to fill in to allow you to apply and win tickets to see the artist again more interaction. Same navbar and social links.
